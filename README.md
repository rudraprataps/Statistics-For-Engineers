# Statistics-For-Engineers
This repository contains all the lab experiments for MAT2001 Statistics For Engineers course, specially for the students of Vellore Institute of Technology. 

Basic Introduction:
• DTMF Encoder Decoder is very easy to use the program to decode DTMF dial tones found on
telephone lines with touch-tone phones.
• DTMF is the global standard for audible tones that represent the digits on a phone keypad.
• DTMF Decoder is also used for receiving data transmissions over the air in amateur radio frequency
bands.
• The signal is encoded as a pair of sinusoidal (sine wave) tones from the table below which are
mixed with each other
• Each DTMF tone is actually two tones – a low-frequency tone and a high-frequency tone
combined, that’s why it is dual-tone multi-frequency.
• Looking at the standard phone keypad as a grid, the low tone corresponds to the row, while the
high tone corresponds to the column.
• DTMF was known throughout the Bell System by the trademark TouchTone. The term was first used
by AT&T on July 5, 1960, and was introduced to the public on November 18, 1963.

# Prerequisites
R Studio should be installed in the computer. 
Please verify all the question and if ther are same then only copy and paste otherwise make changes accordingly. 
For some labs other packages should be installed line #Moments and other. 

# Usage
There are a total of 10 lab tasks. Professors only accept console output not .rmd files. Hence, you can copy the lines of code from the files and paste it in the R Console. 
I have also included the source files for the codes for all the experiments. 

# Contributions
Pull requests and any corrections to the codes are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

# Contact Me
