# Statistics-For-Engineers
This repository contains all the lab experiments for MAT2001 Statistics For Engineers course, specially for the students of Vellore Institute of Technology.  

# Prerequisites
R Studio should be installed in the computer. 
Please verify all the question and if ther are same then only copy and paste otherwise make changes accordingly. 
For some labs other packages should be installed line #Moments and other. 

# Usage
There are a total of 10 lab tasks. Professors only accept console output not .rmd files. Hence, you can copy the lines of code from the files and paste it in the R Console. 
I have also included the source files for the codes for all the experiments.
